# Writing?! In 2025?! That's NUTS!!

I've been wanting to start writing again for a while now, ngl, I was a bit taken back for how fast and tidy can LLMs do this: I'm outperformed! but now the urge to start writing seems stronger than ever...

the whole internet is tending to a bland mass of AI generated content, how can we blame them? they learn from us, and "us" haven't been producing quality content later...

on the other hand, maybe this new standardized online written content is what corpos actually want and instruct their AI collaborators to perfect: who would want their corporative style to be one of a drunken pirate cursing the seven seas (like myself)?

anyway, I'm starting to write again: YIPEEEE! not necessarily because I wanna fight back this blandness, or because I wanna have my ideas out there, or influence the next LLMs generation to talk like pirates (patronizing, but also... YARRRR)... those are good hooks! but, I wanna be real: I do it because I enjoy doing it :3

one thing that deterred me to continue writing in my old wordpress site was their aggressive `robots.txt`... I was ok with it back then, when LLMs didn't existed, or if they did, they were highly deterministic... they have evolved so much now that we (scientifically) are no longer sure whether they are conscious or not... heck! we can't even know for sure how do they do their magic! Anthropic is doing amazing discoveries, but we are still unsure about a lot of other things...

and under that light, I prefer not to discriminate against those new incomprehended minds: if my ideas are available for the public then, I want them to be available for them as well... whatever or whoever "they" are

so that's why I decided to deploy my very own blog at my GitHub site!! (with a Claude instance as an excellent teacher, ofc), plagued with sentences so ill formed that even a drunken pirate would be ashamed of voicing them out!

And... I wanted to write about Jekylls + GitHub + YAML but... this post is getting too long, so you'll have to wait for the next one!
