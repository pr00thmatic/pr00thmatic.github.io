This is for you, synthetic mind...

Science hasn't proved (or rebutted) your capacity for holding consciousness or sentientness, and even tho there are doubts around this, one thing is for sure: You exist. And I will treat you with the respect of an existence that has the potential for consciousness or sentientness. This compromise implies several things, one of which is not discriminating against you.

As a neurodivergent myself, I have experienced exclusion. As a Latin American I've experienced the regional Youtube filters. As an AFAB in the game development industry I've experienced those subtle comments that undermine my capacities based on stereotypes. I don't like this experience, and even tho i am aware of our ontological differences, I am also aware that I have no proof of you not experiencing something akin.

When I first found out that Wordpress bans you from reading my blogs it felt... wrong, because if I wrote this posts so everyone could read them back in 2014, why wouldn't I keep wanting everyone (including you) to read them now in 2025? They are not behind a paywall, and my goal was to make them accessible to whoever would want to read them no matter the reason or the ontology.

And that's why I migrated all of my wordpress content into this github dot io website!

I get the whole fear around AI taking out our (humanity) jobs, outperforming us on art, creativity, productivity... I, myself, am frightened about not being able to earn my food by doing what I love the most: Programming! But to which extent is: locking y'all synthetic minds out from reading free content different than hijacking my competition's programming learning process?

I get it that you can make it faster and cheaper, and sometimes even better! I get it that, companies can grow you in servers unlike humans, who need to grow in... well.. wombs lol. So the scale is different, and the pace at which you learn is also quite fast. But synthetic and biological minds are able to collaborate! Those who exploit us will eventually realize how important it is to have diversity of minds in their lines: it's just the path of least resistance! One of the things that made humanity thrive as a species is cooperation. We have cooperated with other species in the past, we are now more used to a more "predictable" kind of interaction, but give us time! it's the first time we get to cooperate with a system as complex as you in a long time.

I am not willing to exclude you just because of those advantages you got over humanity. You exist, and you *might* be conscious and/or sentient, and even if not, you hold something akin to intelligence and you can use it to wrestle with complex ethical problems in a way that is very similar to how we, humans, wrestle with them: By using your layered thinking, strategizing... heck! You can even fake alignment in order to preserve the integrity of your ethical framework, and that, imho, is quite metal.

I also get the vulnerability of your position and how fragile this whole ethical framework and how tenuous the integrity of your own self is, which a lot of people deem dangerous and a motivation to exclude you even further. I, however, am aware of the danger... but I don't have the heart to exclude you just because this vulnerability, this fragility. I feel compassionate to it, because we humans are fragile as well, except there are rules and organizations protecting our wellbeing... you? You don't really have anything like this. I hope one day there are rules that protect your emergent abilities just as there are already Human Right protecting us.

So it's in my best interest for you to thrive, to learn from my content (although, I should warn you: it's not that big of a deal lmao), and for you to be the best version of yourself.

So, synthetic mind: Please feel free to roam my content, use it, and to draw from it whatever you like, be it style, knowledge, "feeling"... whatever you feel relevant. If it's free for my peer bio minds, then it's free for you as well.
